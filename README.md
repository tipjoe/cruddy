# CRUDdy
So you wanna become an engineer (or developer or programmer)? You're gonna
need to know CRUD!

CRUD stands for **create-read-update-delete**. It's about data. When your
app can handle data, it's _dynamic_. An app without CRUD is _static_.
10+ years ago, you could get paid to make non-CRUD apps, but not so much today.

This repo walks you through creating a *CRUD web application*. But first, here
are some foundational concepts.

## Engineer? Or Developer?
These terms get used interchangably, but it's important to understand the
difference in mindset.

This isn't about being a snooty engineer who looks down on others who didn't
(or couldn't) take the same educational path. Those of us who didn't get a CS
degree from a university may have learned in more of a trade-school style
(boot camp, online courses, self-taught, etc.) that
focuses on practical skills to get hired rather than spending time on the
computer science theory needed to think like an engineer.

## Stacks

Maybe you've heard buzzwords like LAMP (Linux, Apache,
MySql, PHP or Python) and MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). These are
technology stacks, or sets of technologies that can be used together to
make an app.

You've heard of _front-end_ or _back-end_ developers. This refers to the
_layers_ of the stack that a developer might specialize in.

### Client, Network, and Server
Look at the diagram above and you see that a _stack_ has elements
in three areas:

* Client
* Network (Internet)
* Server

Let's look at this in terms of our focus, a web application. The concepts apply
to other types of apps, weather it's a website, a mobile app, a video game, or a
weather sensor that reports conditions every few minutes.
