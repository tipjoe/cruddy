### Client, Network, and Server
Look at the diagram above and you see that a _stack_ has elements
in three areas:

* Client
* Internet (Network)
* Server

Let's look at this in terms of a web application. But the concepts apply to
other types of apps, weather it's a website, a mobile app, a video game, or a
weather sensor that reports conditions every few minutes.

#### Client
Client refers to the code running on a users
